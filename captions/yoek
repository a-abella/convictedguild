		Starting his WoW career off with Papa John's sponsored, Molten Core runs at the age of 15 - Dinkytrinket, aka Yoek, aka Diwas, aka Yoektheheroic, aka Joe, was one of few nimble fitted idiots who spent the better majority of their time sitting in Stormwind rather than studying for a proper American education.<br><br>

"Borrowing" Game Time cards from his local Walmart to support his libatious lifestyle, Dinkytrinket garnered a Core spot in the famous "Death and Taxes" of Shattered Hand as a simple Rogue named Veja. Cruising through the waves of being a celebrity, he swiftly fell off his handle and sifted through the crutches of the depressing onslaught of guilds throughout the next 8 years. <br><br>

Landing softly on one only known as Convicted, Dinktrinket holds rank to competition, while enjoying his lavish lifestyle of Marketing to idiots and raiding a humble 2 days a week.
