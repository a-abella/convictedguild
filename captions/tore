		In early 2009, a Shaman named Tore was ready to quit WoW after watching PUG after PUG wipe on Thaddius in Naxxarams. Instead of quitting, on a whim he applied to a guild called Conviction and was accepted. Initially a very remedial recruit, he narrowly avoided a gkick through patch after patch. Slowly improving through time, he somehow found himself an officer of this competitive guild at the end of WotLK, and helped lead through the early months of Cataclysm until leaving WoW during 4.1. Between then and Warlords of Draenor, he continued to serve as an officer during Conviction's outings in SWTOR and FF:XIV.<br /><br />
With the guild returning to WoW under the new name of Convicted, he reprises his role as officer and guild interrupt slut.
